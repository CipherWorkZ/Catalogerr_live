# Catalogerr – Backup & Archive Tool for Sonarr, Radarr, and Jellyfin

Catalogerr is a **self-hosted media cataloging and backup management tool** designed to complement the **Servarr ecosystem** (Sonarr, Radarr, Lidarr) and **media servers** like Jellyfin and Plex.


Unlike Sonarr and Radarr, which manage only **active libraries**, Catalogerr gives you a **single hub for your entire collection** — including:
- Active drives
- Archived content
- Cold storage and backups

It enriches metadata using **TMDB**, tracks backup status, and provides clear **collection stats** — all inside a familiar **Servarr-style dashboard**.

---

## 🌟 About Catalogerr

Catalogerr makes it easy to know where everything lives — from active drives to cold storage — while giving you **clear insights and tools** to keep your collection healthy.

### Our Mission
Media managers like Sonarr and Radarr focus on **active content**. Catalogerr goes further:
it unifies **active, archived, and backup media** into a **single source of truth**.

### What Makes Catalogerr Different
- 📚 Tracks **active, archive, and cold-storage** drives in one place
- 🔗 Integrates seamlessly with **Sonarr/Radarr** (ARR ecosystem)
- 📊 Provides **stats & health insights** across your entire collection
- ⚡ Built for **automation & transparency** from the ground up

## ⚙️ Installation (New in v1.1.3)

Catalogerr now ships with an **installer script** that sets up everything for you.  

Run:

```bash
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CipherWorkZ/Catalogerr_live/main/install.sh | sudo bash
```

The installer will:
- 📦 Download the latest release archive
- ⚙️ Create `/etc/Catalogerr_live` with proper permissions
- 📝 Generate `.env` and `config.yaml`
- 🔑 Prompt you for an admin password

## ⚙️ Manual Setup Instructions

If you prefer manual setup, create a **`.env`** file in the project root:

```env
# --- Sonarr Integration ---
SONARR_URL=http://<your-sonarr-host>:8989
SONARR_API_KEY=<your-sonarr-api-key>

# --- Radarr Integration ---
RADARR_URL=http://<your-radarr-host>:7878
RADARR_API_KEY=<your-radarr-api-key>

# --- Application Secrets ---
APP_API_KEY=<random-secret-key>
TMDB_API_KEY=<your-tmdb-api-key>

# --- Admin Login ---
ADMIN_USER=admin
ADMIN_PASSWORD=<choose-a-strong-password>

# --- Database ---
DB_FILE=index.db

# --- Application Metadata ---
APP_NAME=Catalogerr
APP_VERSION=1.1.3
INSTANCE_NAME=MyServer

# --- Runtime Information (for system status endpoint) ---
RUNTIME_VERSION=Python 3.12
OS_NAME=Ubuntu
OS_VERSION=22.04
```

---

## 📂 config.yaml

Define which media paths Catalogerr should index:

```yaml
parent_paths:
  - name: movies
    path: /path/to/movies
  - name: tvshows
    path: /path/to/tvshows
  - name: archive
    path: /path/to/archive
```

---

## 🚀 Initialization & Running

After preparing `.env` and `config.yaml`, seed the database:

```bash
python3 admin.py
```

Then run the server:

```bash
python3 main.py
```

Or in production with **Gunicorn**:

```bash
gunicorn -w 4 -b 0.0.0.0:8008 main:app
```

If installed via `install.sh`, Catalogerr will already be running under **systemd**:
```bash
systemctl status catalogerr-api.service
```
